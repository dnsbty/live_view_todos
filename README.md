# LiveViewTodos

This project is a demonstration of how to get started with Phoenix LiveView, and
follows along with this [Phoenix LiveView tutorial by Dennis
Beatty](https://dennisbeatty.com/how-to-create-a-todo-list-with-phoenix-liveview.html).

The tutorial is organized by commits so that you can make sure that each step
looks the same for your project and this one. Feel free to reach out to [Dennis
on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dnsbty) if you have any questions!

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
